Evaluation:

Done:
- Implement a web page, where the user can select a train station from list and get the current timetables (arrival and departure tables)
- Simple nice layout and style for the page created well
- Input field with custom search string is included
- Digitraffic API is used
- In case the user did not select the value the form validation is availible and will couse the alarm message
- Loops are used for fetching the data. 
- In search feeld the words are not case sencetive. 
- Very well functional application
- Comments are avalible in the code

What can be done better:
- Make sorting of the Arrival and Departure tables by time (much easier can be implemented with the external labriries)
- The output of the from-to column can be also station names not code.
